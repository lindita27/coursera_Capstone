Week 4 - Assignment
Requirement :
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. 
Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, 
so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.


Introduction/Business Problem
==============================
The Toronto boroughs has many neighbourhoods with different characteristics.
I would like to perform further analysis on the commonality of venues/businesses of the neighbourhoods in the Toronto Boroughs.
The results of this project will carry answers to questions like people wishing to locate to similar (or disimilar) neghborhoods
from the ones they are moving away from.
Another sub-analysis is the success of businesses (like ratings) and how it differs in each neighbourhood.
